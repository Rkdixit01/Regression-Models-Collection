# Simple Linear Regression
This project provides a straightforward implementation of simple linear regression, a foundational algorithm in machine learning used to analyze relationships within data and make accurate predictions. In this project, we focus on finding the best-fit line, which minimizes the error between the predicted values and actual values in the dataset, ensuring our model can make true predictions effectively.

# Project Overview
Simple linear regression is used here to model the relationship between one independent variable (feature) and a dependent variable (target). The primary goal is to identify a linear relationship that best fits the observed data points, allowing us to predict future values of the target variable based on new feature inputs. By minimizing the residual sum of squares (the difference between observed and predicted values), the model can draw a best-fit line that accurately represents this relationship.

# Objective
To create and train a linear regression model that accurately captures the trend within a dataset and establishes the best-fit line.
To make true predictions for future data points by applying the learned relationship between the feature and the target variable.
# Today's Work
Implemented simple linear regression using Python and relevant libraries.
Explored and preprocessed a dataset to ensure data quality for optimal model performance.
Trained the model on the data, optimizing for minimal prediction error.
Visualized the best-fit line overlaid on the data points to demonstrate how well the model represents the dataset.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
