# Simple Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of simple linear regression to find the best-fit line for making true predictions. The model is trained on a dataset to analyze the relationship between a single feature and the target variable, and the results show a line that best represents the data.

# Objective
To perform simple linear regression to obtain the best-fit line, minimizing error and achieving true predictions.

# Today's Work
Implemented simple linear regression
Analyzed the relationship between feature and target
Plotted the best-fit line for accurate prediction results
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
